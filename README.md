# Hand Grip Strength (HGS) Measurement Setup

This repository contains all the files, CAD models, wiring information, and test code required to build and run a Raspberry Piâ€“based Hand Grip Strength measurement system. The setup combines a linear actuator, a load cell with HX711 amplifier, and 3D/2D printed parts to collect grip force measurements in different configurations.

---

## Quick Start

1. **Assemble hardware**
   - Laser cut brackets from `2D_Printing/`
   - 3D print parts from `3D_Printing/`
   - Wire Raspberry Pi, IBT-2 motor driver, actuator, HX711, and load cell following `Setup_and_Wiring.pdf`

2. **Verify components**
   - Run scripts in `Testing/`:
     - `HX711.py` â†’ check load cell readings
     - `actuator_trial.py` â†’ test actuator forward/backward
     - `actuator_speed_control.py` â†’ test actuator speed with software PWM

3. **Run main experiment**
   - Execute:
     ```bash
     python3 RPi5_LoadCell_LActuator_csv.py
     ```
   - CSV files will be created with timestamps, measured forces, and target forces
   - Follow `dyna_data_collection_guide.pdf` for grip protocols

## Code Overview

The main Python file `RPi5_LoadCell_LActuator_csv.py` integrates the actuator and load cell into a closed-loop system. It continuously reads force values from the HX711 load cell, controls the actuator via the IBT-2 motor driver, and uses a proportional feedback controller to drive the actuator until a target force is reached. Targets are defined as a sequence, and the actuator moves through them automatically. Safety overrides are implemented so that if the measured force exceeds a threshold, the actuator retracts immediately. Each run produces CSV logs containing timestamps, measured forces, and target forces, making it suitable for analysis in Python, MATLAB, or Excel. Repetitions of the test sequence are supported, and logs are stored with timestamps in filenames for organization.

## Workflow

1. **Print and cut parts** â†’ use files in `2D_Printing/` and `3D_Printing/` 
2. **Assemble setup** â†’ follow `Setup_and_Wiring.pdf` for correct wiring and hardware assembly 
3. **Test components** â†’ run the scripts in `Testing/` to confirm functionality 
4. **Run full experiment** â†’ use `RPi5_LoadCell_LActuator_csv.py` to record force sequences automatically 
5. **Collect data** â†’ follow `dyna_data_collection_guide.pdf` to maintain consistent protocols

## Notes

- Adjust GPIO pin numbers in the scripts to match your wiring 
- Calibrate `GRAM_CONVERSION` and `INITIAL_OFFSET` in `HX711.py` or main script for accurate force readings 
- Actuator forces can be high â†’ secure the test rig and check safety override before running 
- CSV log files will accumulate quickly; store them in a dedicated folder for analysis
